## Chapter 1: Core Data Concepts

### Lesson 1.1: Ways to Represent Data
- **Learning Objective:** Learner will be able to describe features of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. 

- **Exercise:** Classify data samples as structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

### Lesson 1.2: Options for Data Storage
- **Learning Objective:** Learner will be able to describe common formats for data files and types of databases and understand relational vs. non-relational databases.
- **Exercise:** Identify appropriate data storage options for different scenarios.

### Lesson 1.3: Common Data Workloads
- **Learning Objective:** Learner will be able to describe features of transactional and analytical workloads. For example, recognise the characteristics of OLTP and OLAP systems.
- **Exercise:** Categorise example workloads as transactional or analytical.

### Lesson 1.4: Roles and Responsibilities for Data Workloads
- **Learning Objective:** Learner will be able to describe responsibilities for database administrators, data engineers, and data analysts.

- **Exercise:** Match roles to their respective responsibilities in a data management scenario.

## Chapter 2: Relational Data on Azure

### Lesson 2.1: Relational Concepts
- **Learning Objective:** Learner will be able to identify features of relational data, normalisation, and common SQL statements.

- **Exercise:** Normalise a database schema and write basic SQL queries.

### Lesson 2.2: Common Database Objects
- **Learning Objective:** Learner will be able to identify common database objects. For example, learners will understand the roles of tables, views, and indexes in a database.
- **Exercise:** Create and use different database objects in an Azure SQL Database.

### Lesson 2.3: Relational Azure Data Services
- **Learning Objective:** Learner will be able to describe the Azure SQL family of products and Azure database services for open-source systems. For example, learners will compare Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and SQL Server on Azure VMs.
- **Exercise:** Deploy an Azure SQL Database and configure it for a specific use case.

## Chapter 3: Non-Relational Data on Azure

### Lesson 3.1: Capabilities of Azure Storage
- **Learning Objective:** Learner will be able to describe Azure Blob, File, and Table storage. For example, learners will understand use cases for each type of storage.
- **Exercise:** Create and configure a Blob storage account and upload data.

### Lesson 3.2: Capabilities and Features of Azure Cosmos DB
- **Learning Objective:** Learner will be able to describe use cases for Azure Cosmos DB and its APIs. For example, learners will understand when to use Cosmos DB for globally distributed applications.
- **Exercise:** Deploy a Cosmos DB instance and perform basic operations using the SQL API.

## Chapter 4: Analytics Workloads on Azure

### Lesson 4.1: Elements of Large-Scale Analytics
- **Learning Objective:** Learner will be able to describe considerations for data ingestion, processing, and analytical data stores. For example, learners will understand the architecture of a modern data warehouse.
- **Exercise:** Design a data ingestion and processing pipeline using Azure Data Factory.

### Lesson 4.2: Azure Services for Data Warehousing and Real-Time Analytics
- **Learning Objective:** Learner will be able to describe Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks, Microsoft Fabric, Azure HDInsight, and Azure Data Factory. For example, learners will understand the differences between batch and streaming data processing.
- **Exercise:** Set up a real-time data processing solution using Azure Stream Analytics.

### Lesson 4.3: Data Visualisation with Power BI
- **Learning Objective:** Learner will be able to identify capabilities of Power BI and appropriate visualisations for data. For example, learners will create data models and dashboards in Power BI.
- **Exercise:** Connect Power BI to Azure data sources and create interactive dashboards.
