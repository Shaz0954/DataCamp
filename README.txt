In this repository you will find the CourseOutline.md and SampleExercise.md files 
which follow the DataCamp interview take home task, 
however I have added two additional files, one with the name of DP900_Exam_Question.py
which contains 10 exam style questions which mimic real questions that could be presented to the learner in the DP-900 exam.
and one with the name of MS_official_documentation.md file which contains official documentation such as their study guide
which can be used so that course writers can easily access the official guidelines and cross reference when creating these courses.
