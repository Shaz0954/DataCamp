In this repository you will find the CourseOutline.md and SampleExercise.md files 
which follow the DataCamp interview take home task, 
however I have added two additional files with the name of DP900_Exam_Question.py
which contains 10 exam style questions which mimic real questions that could be presented to the learner in the DP-900 exam.
I have also included the MS_official_documentation.md file which contains official documentation
which can be used so that course writers can easily access the official guidelines when creating these courses.
