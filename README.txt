In this repository you will find the CourseOutline.md and SampleExercise.md files which follow the DataCamp interview take home task, however I have added two additional files with the name of DP900_Exam_Question.pp which contains 10 exam style questions which mimic real questions that could be presented to the learner in the DP-900 exam. I have also included the MS_offical_documentation.md file which contains official documentation which are added so course writers can easily access the official guidelines when creating these courses.
